    "  - The GET method is used to request data from a server.\n",
    "  - When a client sends a GET request, the server responds by sending back the requested data as part of the response body. This data is usually appended to the URL as query parameters.\n",
    "  - GET requests are commonly used for actions that retrieve data, such as fetching a webpage, retrieving information from a database, or fetching images and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### POST:\n",
    "  - The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by the server.\n",
    "  - When a client sends a POST request, the data is sent in the request body, rather than being appended to the URL.\n",
    "  - POST requests are commonly used for actions that create, update, or delete data on the server, such as submitting a form, adding a new record to a database, or making a purchase."

    "  - In the context of Flask, \"request\" refers to an object that represents the incoming HTTP request made by a client (usually a web browser) to the Flask server.\n",
    "  - This object encapsulates all the information and data associated with the incoming request, allowing you to access various aspects of the request, such as headers, data, query parameters, and more.\n",
    "  - The \"request\" object allows you to access data sent by the client in the request, such as form data, JSON payloads, and query parameters.\n",
    "  - You can use the \"request\" object to determine the HTTP method used by the client (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), which helps you differentiate between different types of requests and handle them appropriately."

    "  -  If you change the structure of your application's URLs, you can use redirects to ensure that old URLs are properly redirected to their new equivalents, helping with search engine optimization (SEO) and maintaining a smooth user experience."
